From the age of **9 - 19**, I have been living in a sea of lies, unfortunately, we never know and there is no one to blame here. We have been pampered in such a way that we came to a **conclusion,** Oh! This is the world and we gotta do things in the way we have been taught to.

One of the basic and overrated things is **Motivation** from song to quotes on your gadgets it lives everywhere. But what If we question it? Does Motivation Always work? To be Successful does motivation essential?

Remember the times I was so dumb plugging up earphones on, playing down a playlist of **hard beat songs** thinking that would help me to get pumped up.

Surprisingly it did!!! But here how it looks like, you feel the *adrenaline* making you feel as if this moment is yours and heroic feel kicks in.

I have been there quite a lot of times than usual but at the same time, I have been to more disappointments just because of that shitty *adrenaline* pump. Why?

It doesn't last forever or at least the end of the subject we wanna do, It's like getting our head into it at first heading start and feel completely clueless after 10 mins or so Why the hell we are here!

**Where is your so called *Motivation* now ?** 

## Why It Happens ?

Motivation occurs depends upon the circumstances and state of our mind, but we know things won't be easy or in favor of us every time. When the circumstances started to feel the heaviness our **motivation** tends to fade away with time.

People bragging about motivation saying it's their entire fuel for success, trust me it's not. They might misinterpret **the obsession** with motivation. Why successful people don't give up?

Because they are **obsessed with being successful**, they don't mind or deal with shitty motivation songs counting on them for taking them to the success train.

## Replacing Motivation with Obsession :

For being obsessed with something there will be a **purpose,** this thing drives your way to success no matter what comes in between you or how many hindrances you hit by the journey. It is linear.

Where when we speak about **motivation,** it need not be having a purpose. Just a pump of total *adrenaline* shots making you feel confident for the time being.

## My take on Motivation :

When I started the #100daysofdeeplearning thing at first, I had nothing in my mind except being pumped up seeing people doing this **100 days** thing feels exciting.

The first day, it was all good merely perfect. Because I was all in and the *adrenaline tank is still in the game.*

Then comes **Day 2,** began to feel a little distressed and there wasn't a constant set of mood to go with the challenge.

**Day 3,** this where things started to get crazy. I wasn't focusing rather I blamed myself why I dragged myself into this all of a sudden.

Clearly, my **motivation** had run out of fuel. I was confused when everything broke down and I wasn't keeping up my progress. And then I came to know about **Obsession** and training myself towards it now.

Summing up, choose a purpose — Write it down — Say to yourself every morning — Work for a purpose and lemme know how this works for you then!


Also lemme know what you want me to write about aswell! Or any feedbacks I love to have them 🎯
