When is the last time you felt gratitude about things? What was it all about? Do you remember? Or had you ever felt sometimes grateful?

In today's modern world people mostly run behind or feel anxious about things that others have. But we don't pay attention to whatever things we have in the present. Be it anything a materialistic thing, loved ones, pet it can be anything.

We all have been in the same shoes, it's not a problem at all. But it can be when the **anticipation** level hits off the roof. We always worry about things we don't have in our life but a slight peek towards the things we have won't be a crime. Think about it.

There is no one to blame other than **Social Media**, I see that's the place jealousy being born and we failed to remember things which matters the most. We see people here with great talents, good looking than us, rich of-course yeah! , driving a Lambo sometimes hmm!!

**Jealousy** is usual but it should be a healthy one, counting on it we should move out and work on getting things done rather than just being jealous. 

I have been there I count on things which I don't have and feel shit about it, concluding that If we have that thing we will be happy or feel enough satisfied.

With all these shits going on I felt lost and looking out even most people do. I came over the idea of being Gratitude, I took a paper and pen all of a sudden. My mission is to write 10 things which I feel grateful for It started like this......

**I feel grateful for...**( a long pause ) I was having trouble figuring out what I am grateful for. Then you know I hit up google typed something like ' **What are the things people usually forget to be grateful for '**

Opened a random article's gave a read, it's time for me to write down. I was excited for no reason, it went like...

**I am grateful for having food at my table 3 times a day.** 

Do we think about this? Did we get these things easily aren't they? , as a reflex action, we need not be worried about it. But out for some people it's a big deal instead.

After writing a list of 10 things down, I read it again and feel the emotion inside myself. And think about people who don't get these amenities or things we easily facilitate it. While doing them the entire day feels best as if you hold something precious in you than others out there.

In this fast-paced world rather than anticipating or worrying about things we don't have, we can all have a pause and think about the stuff we do have and feel our **gratitude** towards it.
