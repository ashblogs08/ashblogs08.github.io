# Things I figured out before turning 20

I never felt old ever in my life, as we always wish to fast forward to the 20's + age feeling our childhood sucks. Even I have been there dreaming about the life after 20 when I was 13, thinking about the things I can do without any supervision or barriers, thinking about the liberal life etc.. 

Things passed by really fast and tomorrow I am gonna be **20 years old,** Ufff!! but now I wish it should have creeped by or wish to live all those years again one more time. Sounds fascinating to hear but in reality we cant even move a shit.

## Screw the Past, Fill the Future

Nothing can change the fact that I am going to turn 20, rather worrying about it I gotta look back and peek through the past of mine. I asked this question to me **Why I don't wanna be 20 ? ,** took me time to answer thats a simple question still it holds a lot of meaning.

The answer was brutal truth instead which was simple as the question but hard to take in, **I wasted my time and putting things on Future self would take care of.** 

At the Present I was postponing things which lead me pass all those years and stopped by me at **20** making me feel shit. But I read this poem somewhere in the Internet which gave me hope that I can still turn things aside me. 

> The past is the past for a reason. That is where it is supposed to stay, But some cannot let it go. In their heads it eats away
