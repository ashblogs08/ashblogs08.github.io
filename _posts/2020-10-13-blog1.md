# Things I figured out before turning 20

![](/images/blog1-pic1.jpg "main pic")

I never felt old ever in my life, as we always wish to fast forward to the 20's + age feeling our childhood sucks. Even I have been there dreaming about the life after 20 when I was 13, thinking about the things I can do without any supervision or barriers, thinking about the liberal life etc.. 

Things passed by really fast and tomorrow I am gonna be **20 years old,** Ufff!! but now I wish it should have creeped by or wish to live all those years again one more time. Sounds fascinating to hear but in reality we cant even move a shit.
