# Things I figured out before turning 20

I never felt old ever in my life, as we always wish to fast forward to the 20's + age feeling our childhood sucks. Even I have been there dreaming about the life after 20 when I was 13, thinking about the things I can do without any supervision or barriers, thinking about the liberal life etc.. 

Things passed by really fast and tomorrow I am gonna be **20 years old,** Ufff!! but now I wish it should have creeped by or wish to live all those years again one more time. Sounds fascinating to hear but in reality we cant even move a shit.

## Screw the Past, Fill the Future

Nothing can change the fact that I am going to turn 20, rather worrying about it I gotta look back and peek through the past of mine. I asked this question to me **Why I don't wanna be 20 ? ,** took me time to answer thats a simple question still it holds a lot of meaning.

The answer was brutal truth instead which was simple as the question but hard to take in, **I wasted my time and putting things on Future self would take care of.** 

At the Present I was postponing things which lead me pass all those years and stopped by me at **20** making me feel shit. But I read this poem somewhere in the Internet which gave me hope that I can still turn things aside me. 

> The past is the past for a reason. 
  That is where it is supposed to stay, 
  But some cannot let it go. 
  In their heads it eats away
  
  
  ## Project's > Certificates

For the past 6 months LinkedIn been filling up people's posting their certificates, especially one person arranging those certificates in a beautiful manner like a flower. By seeing those posts everyday while scrolling through I felt like, Shit seems like everyone is learning at a lightning speed whereas me sticking with one course for a long time!!! 

I started to rush courses and posting certificates on LinkedIn getting those dumb likes and felt happy with that until I messed up. 

Then I did a project by myself thinking about I can get this done, but I fucked up really bad. I realized all I was doing is to rush the course and get the certificate's but never intended to acquire knowledge. 

Certificate's is a piece of paper which indicates you learnt these skills but it never guarantee's you will deliver those skills. There is no use of learning something and not delivering it to solve problems, I took a step ahead to quit out from the Certificate Parody.
