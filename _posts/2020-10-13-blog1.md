# Things I figured out before turning 20

![](/images/blog1-pic1.jpg "main pic")

I never felt old ever in my life, as we always wish to fast forward to the '20s + age feeling our childhood sucks. Even I have been there dreaming about life after 20 when I was 13, thinking about the things I can do without any supervision or barriers, thinking about liberal life, etc..

Things passed by really fast and tomorrow I am gonna be **20 years old,** Ufff!! but now I wish it should have crept by or wish to live all those years again one more time. Sounds fascinating to hear but in reality, we can't even move a shit.

## Screw the Past, Fill the Future

Nothing can change the fact that I am going to turn 20, rather than worrying about it I gotta look back and peek through the past of mine.

 I asked this question to me **Why I don't wanna be 20? ,** took me time to answer that's a simple question still it holds a lot of meaning.

The answer was brutal truth instead which was simple as the question but hard to take in, **I wasted my time and putting things on Future self would take care of.**

At the present, I was postponing things that lead me to pass all those years and stopped by me at **20** making me feel shit. But I read this poem somewhere on the Internet which gave me hope that I can still turn things to my side.

> The past is the past for a reason. That is where it is supposed to stay, But some cannot let it go. In their heads, it eats away

I decided to move ahead without any worries holding back, but with a better plan of avoiding this feeling every year replacing it with *happiness* and *accomplishments.*

I had figured out certain things which I was doing wrong all those years, there is still hiding in which I can't but for now, I have hope by fixing these pieces of stuff I won't fill myself with regret next year hopefully!

## Project's > Certificates

For the past 6 months, LinkedIn has been filling up people's posting their certificates, especially one person beautifully arranging those certificates like a flower. 

By seeing those posts every day while scrolling through I felt like, Shit seems like everyone is learning at a lightning speed whereas me sticking with one course for a long time!!!

I started to rush courses and posting certificates on LinkedIn getting those dumb likes and felt happy with that until I messed up.

Then I did a project by myself thinking about I can get this done, but I fucked up really bad. I realized all I was doing is to rush the course and get the certificate's but never intended to acquire knowledge.

Certificates are a piece of paper that indicates you learned these skills but it never guarantees you will deliver those skills. There is no use in learning something and not delivering it to solve problems, then I took a step ahead to quit out from the Certificate Parody.

## Tap in to Spiritual World

Wake Up , Eat , Work Repeat... 

That's the lifestyle I had been in, but still whatever I do there is less satisfaction when I go to bed everyday night. A feeling of incompleteness which makes me drown in the lake of guilt.

I pray but I am very inconsistent with it, even when I intend to do I get easily distracted and pass by the time. The weird thing is everything falls into my mind when I go to sleep and I don't know how it happens till now.

I gotta fix this cycle by making myself to know the importance of prayer and be consistent with it by time for the purpose of achieving mindfulness and the paradise.

## Fix the balance between Creation Vs Consumption

Earlier this year January, I took a course on ML at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/), but I never thought it will change my whole life into a new shift.

The instructor of the course now became my friend (I can say) named [Daniel Bourke](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8O8l5cCX85Oem1d18EezQ), watched one of his videos named [A balance you need to fix: Creation vs. Consumption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKHJrTHB5rM). 

After this shits started to make sense, that what I had been doing so long was not the optimal way and I gotta fix this balance asap.

In simple words, avoid falling into Tutorial Hell and start creating or work on projects. Things more stay still in our mind when we solve it that's the key to fixing this balance.

I am looking forward to Creating more than I Consume this year things like :

- Spend more time on Research Papers than Youtube Tutorials.
- Spending more time on Kaggle than Courses.
- Read more books and experiment with it.

## Become Healthy than never before

Since my childhood, I am prone to many diseases, at the age of 4 my parents found out I got asthma and till to this day, it's been my loyal friend sticking with me for so long than most of the real friends.

Thank God, Corona didn't find a way still to make friendship till now. But for the past 3 months, I have been falling sick more often.

I would have been happy if this happened when my college was open so that I could get days off, but now when I am on a journey to learn skills this is the greatest barrier.

Not Physically, but even mentally it broke me down the times I feel hard to breathe and rush to the hospital. My whole Mental empire breaks brick by brick before I could build it entirely with no time.

Summing up, the goal of this year is to work on my health and minimize the hospital bills as best as I can. I am planning to learn meditation and Yoga meanwhile learn about my body to improve my longevity.
