While writing this blog out, **grill** **chicken** is been waiting for me outside. I love food especially anything with chicken is the world to me. But I don’t wanna eat it now.

I have not written my blog yet, which I **committed** myself to write blogs for every 365 days and publish them. To get done most of the job I believe in expecting a **reward** whatever it can be, waking up at 4 am to clean my room.

Now my eyes are on writing blog now, the chicken part comes to reality only after hitting the publish button.  

## Why It works ?

We are humans after all and we do our work best when there is a return of something which rejoices us. I can stack up tons of examples ahead, but we gotta understand our brain for **WHY** it happens. 

> The regions of the brain comprising the **reward system** use the neurotransmitter dopamine to communicate. Dopamine-producing neurons in the *ventral tegumental area* (VTA) communicate with neurons in the nucleus accumbents in order to evaluate rewards and motivate us to obtain them.
Alright! Enough of Jargon it's not a science lab indeed. **Dopamine** plays a vital role in the whole process, it secretes reward system hormones in us. This what makes us feel pumped for the reward.

We work in a **9–5 job** for a month and we get paid at the last, and that makes us happy, you see achieving reward is a process indeed. We, humans, work on a **reward** The Golden Cup, after waking up from bed If I successfully survived without any gadgets intervening the first hour of my day, I reward myself with a cup of Black Coffee or Tea. Caffeine gets me into focus mode, whenever I feel out bounded a cup of coffee gets me in the game, so the cup of beverage's important. every day in our day to day life, more money we never fail to commit ourselves to it.

## How to use Reward System to fix ourselves

I have a habit of hitting up the phone as soon as I woke up, which killed my productivity every day. When you first awake, your brain operates at the **alpha** **stage**. It's been called the gateway to the **subconscious** **mind**.

Scrolling through social media etc surpasses our brain and lets the alpha waves die in vain.

Sharing my experience out how I set myself up for rewards and get things done, I have great names for them tho.

**Happy Meal,** there will be times where I am stuck with a lot to do. Getting the focus into the work sometimes feel tedious, if so I go on  **16 hours fast.** 

I plan this beforehand of the day, I will eat my meal around 3 at the noon. By this, my mind is out of food and it's me and the work now. Whatever the circumstances I feel light and focused on doing this and the crave for a reward at noon cracks me up!

You get to work on your diet meanwhile tho, so it's a Win-Win!! 

The above are the main type of reward system I set up myself with regularly. There are more which is customizable depending upon the tasks. 

You now would have got a glimpse of how to form your own **Reward System**, and you can find out them by : 

- Write down where you feel stuck, which task is important and somehow you fail to work on them.
- Choose something which you can't survive with, it can be a phone or food whatever close to you. Set some restrictions upon them.
- Do the task now, and set the **important** thing as your reward.

My chicken is up for me now, and you can see the blog is done tho. How useful the **reward system** was ? 

Work it on yourself and lemme know, what good it had done for you! 

Have a great day!
