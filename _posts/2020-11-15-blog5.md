Its been 6 months still we have locked up inside our houses due to Covid-19. These days caused more pain and loss for numerous people out there and some of them utilized this time for their best.

This was the time, LinkedIn took a whole new shift from being a Professional Networking platform to some kind of low-key Instagram or Facebook. Everyone including me was hyped to post the **certificates** we got from our courses in this platform. 

It was all good until I realized I was more into finishing courses rather than caring about the takeaways. Things made sense when I tried to work on my project, I learned skills from a course but it didn't help me to satisfy my needs on working on that project. I asked Why I can't do this?

The fault was on me for sure and I was so influenced by seeing people's out there on LinkedIn posting their **certificates**, gave me an idea people are so fast paced in learning new skills. I tried to fit myself into this infamous race of collecting certificates but never care about my learnings.

The idea is simple, doing more courses in a skillset never gets you better in that skill. The more courses you do gets you better in finishing courses. I have done 4 courses in Python, but still working on sites like Hackerrank, etc.

I was able to improve my skills. Those 4 courses all taught me the same shit, again, and again, I blamed courses that they can't deliver my needs but little do I know it was all on me. I was stuck inside the **tutorial hell**.

All I was doing is looking for courses that will teach me the whole of the skill and get me paid. I was wrong indeed and I was looping myself in different courses day-in and day-out.

I was unhappy with me, there was a thrust going inside me to fix this collapse. Then I came over the idea of [**Creation Vs Consumption](https://youtu.be/vKHJrTHB5rM)** from Daniel Bourke. From then I worked on fixing my cycle, lowering the consumption as much as I can and set the bars high for Creation.

## How I got out from Tutorial Hell

I stopped taking more courses rather than working on projects, If I got stuck a Google search for hours will deliver my needs.

In this way, I will able to learn things which I wanted to for the time being moreover chances are high we remember things for a long time when we work our ass off to find it or fix it.

I minimized my consumption or study materials, got into the world of experimenting with things, and reading blogs to know something when needed. It's a bit hard way of doing things but also a fun way of learning new things.

Try to replicate what I had been taught in course at first. If thats a success, will try to put that work in my own style by adding new add-ons into it. 

Fixing the loop from, 

**Courses —> Interpret —> Courses** 

To,

**Materials —> Interpret —> Replicate —> Optimize —> Repeat** 

Shifting our energy is key, what we do to what should we do. Set up your balance stable the more you consume make sure you create an equal amount of things.

Have a great day!
